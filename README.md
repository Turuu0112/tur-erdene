## About

The Pinecone Intern Monorepo is a collection of projects developed by interns at Pinecone. These projects range from small utilities to more complex applications, all built with the goal of learning and contributing to the company's internal tooling. This monorepo structure allows for better code sharing, dependency management, and collaboration among interns.

This repository serves as a learning platform for interns to gain experience with TypeScript, Node.js, and modern development practices. It provides a space to experiment with new technologies and contribute to real-world projects. The target audience includes current and future Pinecone interns, as well as Pinecone employees interested in leveraging or contributing to these internal tools.

The monorepo is built using TypeScript and managed with npm. Each project within the monorepo has its own set of dependencies and build processes. The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new projects and features. A key advantage of this approach is the ability to share common code and dependencies across multiple projects, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Variety of Tools**: Contains a diverse set of internal tools and utilities.
- ⚡ **Efficient Development**: Monorepo structure facilitates code sharing and dependency management.
- 🔒 **Secure**: Adheres to Pinecone's internal security standards.
- 🎨 **Consistent UI**: Aims for a unified look and feel across all projects.
- 📱 **Responsive**: Tools are designed to be accessible on various devices.
- 🛠️ **Extensible**: New projects and features can be easily added to the monorepo.

## 🎬 Demo

Since this is an internal monorepo, a public demo is not available. However, here are some example screenshots of potential tools:

## 🚀 Quick Start

To get started with a specific project within the monorepo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pinecone-studio/pinecone-intern-monorepo.git
cd pinecone-intern-monorepo/projects/your-project-name
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the appropriate port for your project) to view it in your browser.

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pinecone-studio/pinecone-intern-monorepo.git
cd pinecone-intern-monorepo

# Navigate to the specific project
cd projects/your-project-name

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## 💻 Usage

Each project within the monorepo has its own specific usage instructions. Refer to the README file within each project directory for detailed information.

### Example: Using a utility function

```typescript
// Import a utility function from another project
import { utilityFunction } from '../shared-utils/src/index';

// Example usage
const result = utilityFunction('input');
console.log(result);
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configuration varies depending on the specific project. Some projects may use environment variables, while others may rely on configuration files.

### Environment Variables

```env
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

### Configuration File

```json
{
  "projectName": "example-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "settings": {
    "theme": "light",
    "loggingEnabled": true
  }
}
```
